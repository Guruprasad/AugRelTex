Augmented Reality is a novel field poised to change the way users 
interact with their environments. Very interesting applications 
have already been implemented in Devices like Samsung Galaxy Tab, which can
tell the user the kind of food and how many seats are left in a restaurant
, when the device is just pointed at the restaurant.
More such applications are likely to come up , as Augmented Reality SDKs
become available and more feature-rich.
But the ultimate goal of AR would be to augment information to the user's
environment without the need for any display devices (i.e provide seem-less
integration of the Virtual Element and The Real Elements in the environment)
This is quite an ambitious goal, as this requires multidisciplinary research
and collaboration efforts.
